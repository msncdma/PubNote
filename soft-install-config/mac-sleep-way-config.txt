Mac的睡眠方式说明：
0 (quick): Default sleep behavior on most Apple computers. RAM is still powered on while
sleeping. Wake up is fast. Safe sleep is disabled.
1 (deep): Hibernation behavior. System is totally shut down while sleeping. RAM contents
are dumped to disk. Wake up is slow.
3 (safe): Default behavior on Powerbook HD and later computers. RAM is still powered
on while sleeping. Wake up is fast. Safe sleep is enabled, so RAM contents are
also dumped to disk before going to sleep.
5 (deep): Same as mode 1 for systems with encrypted virtual memory.
7 (safe): Same as mode 3 for systems with encrypted virtual memory
注： 我使用5的时候无法正常唤醒，因此不建议使用5&7
查看当前的睡眠模式： pmset -g | grep hibernatemode
修改睡眠模式： sudo pmset -a hibernatemode X
